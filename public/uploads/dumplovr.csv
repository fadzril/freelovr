Lucky enough to have built my career on what I have loved – writing and PR, I have over 6 years of “official” experience in public relations, communications, Marcomm and editorial management with both the traditional and new media. I have freelanced for national and international publications and websites and been on the editorial team (read, one person) for many newsletters for various associations. Currently am heading the PR team for one of the fastest  growing media houses in Malaysia. Aside from that, I specialise in all forms of social media and if there is something I don't specialise in.. I am a fast learner!

I have worked with people across the corporate strata, from Chairpersons and Managing Directors to designers, section editors, clients, media, third party partners, sometimes even fourth party partners! And have thus developed my ability to really understand what people want and how to work with diverse, multi functional teams. Innovative and effective media and public relation solutions along with constant learning are my mantras and whacky workable ideas, quality, on-time delivery are my trademarks.","@marc_ky

Picking up other languages along the way based on demand/necessity.,"I can learn any language and master it in weeks. I code modular, extensible, reusable codes which are clearly understandable and usually cater for a wide range of scenarios for possible extension/tweaks.

I'm a master of coding classes to define business/process logic and can encapsulate and modularize any logic you can imagine.

I never settle for ""this works"" and always aim for ""this is how everything should work"".

I never settle with ""this caters to the requirements"" and always aim for ""this will probably cater for most likely changes"".

I never settle with ""it's unlikely that the system will hit this scenario/condition (and crash)"" and always make sure the system is loophole-free.",@jerng,MYR,60,hour
